# Project Overview

Open Hearts Loud Mics is a fun and inclusive 3-day music festival aimed at supporting better Sex Education for teens and young adults with the goal of breaking down barriers surrounding sexuality. The festival seeks to create an exciting and lively environment for people of all backgrounds to have fun, enjoy great musical acts, learn from sex education experts, and celebrate and support the betterment of sex education. The festival has a unique Y2K aesthetic, blending nostalgia with modern style, and educational goals.

The Open Hearts Loud Mics festival needed a fun and colorful website that followed the Y2K aesthetic that the festival is uniquely known for. And we also had to add supporting information and graphics for the organizations that the festival led support to.

Some pages that the Open Hearts Loud Mics website required were a home page, an about page, a dates page for the events, a subsection with the details about the activities taking course over the duration of the festival, a page to display merchandise and resources related to the festival, and a group of pages that would create a fun shopping experience so the user could purchase products they were interested in.

# Technical Overview

This web design project uses a combination of HTML and CSS across the entirety of the page. The HTML file is where the content is coded. CSS was used to change the visual look of the page. Along with changing the visual aspect, CSS was also used to create and apply animations and transitions.

Before the coding begun wireframes were created to establish a visual guide for how the project was supposed to look. All of the logos were imported from Adobe Illustrator into Figma and accompanying photography was sourced from Unsplash.com a service which allows users to use photos from Unsplash for free, including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the photographer or Unsplash.

All of the HTML & CSS were coded with Visual Studio Code. The wireframes created were made with Figma. All web fonts were imported from Adobe Fonts. All of the logo variations and accompanying illustrations made using Adobe Illustrator. The Open Hearts Loud Mics logo guidelines were created using Adobe InDesign.
